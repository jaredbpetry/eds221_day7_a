# Mutating Joins 

```{r}
#---- use data pasta to create a dataframe

animals <- tibble::tribble(
  ~location,   ~species,  ~maturity,
   "lagoon",   "bobcat",    "adult",
    "bluff",   "coyote", "juvenile",
    "creek",      "fox",    "adult",
     "oaks", "squirrel", "juvenile",
    "bluff",   "bobcat",    "adult"
  )

sites <- tibble::tribble(
           ~location,      ~full_site_name, ~jurisdiction,
            "beach",       "Goleta Beach",     "SB City",
           "lagoon",        "UCSB Lagoon",        "UCSB",
            "bluff",       "Ellwood Mesa",     "SB City",
             "oaks", "Fremont Campground",        "USFS"
           )
```

### Full Join 

```{r}
#if you have multiple matching column names, you can add the argument 'by = '

full_join_example <- full_join(animals, sites)  #-- nothing gets omitted

#automatically found that the matching column was location and joined by location

```

### Left Join 

```{r}
left_join_example <- left_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### Inner Join

```{r}
inner_join_example <- inner_join(animals, sites, by = "location")

#change the key name

sites2 <- sites |> 
  rename(loc = location)

#example of joining when key variables have non-matching names 
#so the key doesn't have to be matching if you manually specify this 

nonmatching <- full_join(animals, sites2, by = c("location" = "loc"))
```

# Filtering Joins

### Semi-join 

```{r}
#filtering joins will not add columns! 
semi_join_ex <- semi_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
  
```

### Anti-join 

```{r}
#only obs. are retained in x if they do not have a match in y
anti_join_ex <- anti_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

# Data Wrangling Refresher 

**Refresher 1:** Starting with the `penguins` dataset in the `palmerpenguins`package, write a single piped sequence in which you:

1.  Only include penguins at Biscoe and Dream islands

2.  Remove the `year` and `sex` variables

3.  Add a new column called `body_mass_kg`, with penguin mass converted from grams to kilograms

4.  Rename the `island` variable to `location`

```{r}
penguins_sub1 <- penguins |> 
  filter(island %in% c("Biscoe", "Dream")) |> 
  select(-year, -sex) |> 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000) |> 
  rename(location = island) #remember to do new name = old name (weird)

```

**Refresher 2:** Staring with the `penguins` dataset in the `palmerpenguins`package, write a single piped sequence in which you:

1.  Limit to only Adelie penguins

2.  Remove any observations where `flipper_length_mm` is `NA` (hint: `!is.na()`)

3.  Group the data by `sex`

4.  Find the mean (`mean()`), standard deviation (`sd`) and sample size (`n`) of flipper_length_mm for male and female Adelie penguins, returned in a nice summary table

\

```{r}
penguins_sub2 <- penguins |> 
  filter(species == "Adelie") |> 
  filter(!is.na(flipper_length_mm)) |>  #take out rows where flipper length is NA
  group_by(sex) |> 
  summarize(mean_flipper = mean(flipper_length_mm), 
            sd_flipper = sd(flipper_length_mm), 
            sample_size_flipper = length(flipper_length_mm))
```
